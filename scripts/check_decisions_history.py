"""check_decisions_history.py — decision ledger entries are immutable.

``docs/decisions/`` is an append-only record of product and design decisions a
person on the team made. Each entry is one file; the directory's README is the
front page and index. The rules are in ``docs/decisions/README.md``; this gate
enforces the one that can be checked without reading:

    every ``docs/decisions/*.md`` present at the base ref, except ``README.md``,
    must exist at head byte-identical

A deleted entry, a renamed entry and an edited entry all fail. A new regular-file
entry is allowed, because appending is the only way the ledger grows. At both
base and head, the directory admits only this README and flat regular ``*.md``
files, nothing else. A closed list of admitted shapes is checkable; a growing
list of refused shapes is not. Every child is validated before the README is
exempted from byte comparison: a link resolves to whatever its target says, so
its resolved bytes are not the entry's bytes. Base entries and file modes come
from Git's immediate-child tree listing, not the checkout. The ledger directory
itself must be a tree at base and a real directory at head, not a link to another
ledger. Head entries are checked without following links before their bytes are
read. The README's bytes may change because adding an entry means adding its
index row, and docs-lint refuses an unindexed doc.

Every ``git`` call runs in the repository root, resolved from this file's own
location, never in the caller's working directory. The two sides of the
comparison must come from the same repository, and the base side is a path
lookup: ``git ls-tree <ref> -- docs/decisions`` resolves that path against the
directory git runs in, so from any other directory it matches nothing, and a
ledger that matches nothing is indistinguishable from an empty one. A gate that
read the base from the caller's CWD would therefore pass silently, reporting
"0 entries intact", whenever it was invoked from a subdirectory. The self-test
proves the verdict does not depend on the CWD.

## Why this is a deterministic gate and not a review rule

An entry exists so that a later change does not quietly reverse a decision. The
easiest way to reverse one is to make the record say something else, or to make
it say nothing: an "edit" that softens a sentence, a rename that drops the file
out of a grep, a deletion buried in a hunk beside a real change. All three read
as plausible in review, because the reviewer looks at what was added. So the
judgment half of the rule (does this change reverse a recorded decision without
a superseding entry?) stays in ``AUTOSDE.yaml``, where a reviewer applies it, and
the mechanical half lives here, where no reviewer has to notice anything.

A change of mind is a NEW entry naming the one it supersedes, so the correct
shape of a ledger diff is additions only, and this gate has **no exemptions**.

## Usage

    # enforce against a base ref (exit 1 on any violation)
    DECISIONS_BASE_REF="$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)" \\
        python3 scripts/check_decisions_history.py

    # self-test: one probe per defect class, assert each verdict
    python3 scripts/check_decisions_history.py --test

With no ``DECISIONS_BASE_REF`` the check still enforces the closed-world head
content rule, then exits 0 with a note when there is nothing to compare against.

Pass the MERGE BASE, not the base branch's moving tip. CI passes
``pull_request.base.sha`` and tests the merge ref, so the two agree there; locally
they do not. A branch that is merely BEHIND a base which has since gained an
entry reports that entry as missing — true and useless. The merge base is the
commit the branch actually departed from, so it answers "did THIS branch remove
or rewrite anything".
