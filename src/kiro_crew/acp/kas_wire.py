"""Localized parsing for the second ACP backend's KAS-specific wire surfaces.

Two surfaces live here, and they share one property: the shapes are the second
backend's, not ordinary ACP, so this module is the ONE place Kiro Crew reads or
builds them and an adjustment is a single-file edit.

1. ``session/update`` display/telemetry frames, whose discriminant blob arrives
   in a different shape than ``kiro-cli``'s. The handlers that act on a parsed
   frame live in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle`.
2. The **hooks** surface: the backend can delegate hook extraction to its ACP
   client, asking ``_kiro/hooks/list`` for the hooks matching a trigger and
   ``_kiro/hooks/sessionStart`` for results computed before the turn. Kiro Crew
   answers both from its own hook store, so the matcher stays on the side where
   the UI that authored the hook lives.

The literals below are only what Kiro Crew must match to route a frame or answer
a request; the backend's own internals are not documented here.

Read-only by construction. The third method of that surface,
``_kiro/hooks/executeHook``, is the one that spawns a command, and nothing here
implements it: an inbound request naming it is classified as an unknown server
request and answered ``-32601``.

The ids this module mints are Kiro Crew's own, and an execute path may only run
one it listed for the session that asks. The RECORD of what was listed belongs
with that execute path rather than here: it answers a question nothing in this
build asks, and the same change owes it the owning session key it has to be
keyed by (see ``docs/system-specs/modules/agent-host-contract.md``).
