"""Authenticated record of which nudge loops a crew/member session armed ITSELF.

``NudgeLoop.self_armed`` is the one bit that relaxes the crew/member
external-arm refusal at fire time (``GatewayOrchestrator._fire_dashboard_nudge``),
and the loop store it lives in (``autonudge.json``) is agent-writable: an
agent -- or a prompt injected into one -- can write ``"self_armed": true`` on a
loop it did not arm from that session, and a restart would restore it. The
persisted bit alone is therefore not authorization; it is a hint that must
AGREE with a record the agent cannot forge.

That record lives here, in a GATEWAY-ONLY directory of its own under the data
home, ``autonudge-trust/`` (:func:`self_arm_record_path`), with all three ways
of writing it closed on that one name: the agent's file tools are fenced by
``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``, a sandboxed shell -- a command that builds the
path at runtime, which no text matcher sees -- is bind-masked by
``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` (pre-created before every spawn so the mask has a
name to cover on a fresh install, and refused when aliased by a link), and no
in-sandbox code opens it: only gateway code opening the path directly -- the
authorizer at the moment it admits an arm, the owner's switch, the store's
remove -- ever reads or writes it. NOT under ``trust/``: that directory is a
declared sandbox READ-WRITE exception (in-sandbox MCP servers append to the
audit log there and ``verify_session_pid`` reads the SEL key), so a record
under it stayed writable by a same-UID sandboxed command, and an entry is the
whole of an owner arm's fire-time admission. A record an upgraded install still
has at the ``trust/`` layout is DISCARDED on first access, not migrated
(:func:`_retire_legacy_record`): its entries may be the sandbox's, so the loops
behind them are refused until armed again. The fire-time guard admits a crew/member wake
only when BOTH hold: ``loop.self_armed is True`` on the record it loaded AND
``is_recorded_self_arm(loop.id, loop.slot_key)`` here. A forged bit with no
trust entry refuses; a stale trust entry with no bit refuses.

One flat JSON object ``{loop_id: {"slot_key": ..., "armed_ts": ...}}``. An entry
is written by exactly one path (the authorizer admitting a self-arm) and REVOKED
by exactly one path: its loop leaving the store (``AutoNudgeService.remove_sync``
calls :func:`forget_self_arm` on remove and on replacement), so a removed loop's
id cannot keep its authorization and the file cannot grow past the loops that
were armed and not yet removed. A write never prunes against a caller-supplied
view of the store -- see :func:`record_self_arm` for the race that would open.
Every read-modify-write runs under an exclusive file lock so two concurrent
self-arms cannot drop each other's entries. Every reader is TOTAL: a
missing, unreadable or malformed file reads as "not recorded", which is the
refusing answer.

Blocking file IO throughout -- async callers offload via ``asyncio.to_thread``.
