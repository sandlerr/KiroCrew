"""Crewmate teams HTTP handlers -- ``/api/teams``.

A team is a name plus an ordered list of crewmates (``kiro_crew.crew_teams``). The
Crewmates page groups its roster by team and opens a team view per team; this
module is the list/create/rename/re-member/delete surface behind that.

Same posture as the members routes: dashboard-only (app tokens are denied with
404, deny-by-default), reads need the dashboard session, writes are OWNER
actions (``require_owner_dashboard_request``) because the document is the
owner's grouping and lives in a gateway-only masked directory
(``crew_teams.TEAMS_DIR_NAME``).

Members are validated against the registered crew names at write time so a
team can never be created around a crewmate that does not exist. That
validation and the write run under the crew registry's own config lock
(``agents._get_config_lock``), the lock the crew-delete route holds while it
removes a crew and drops it from its team (``crew_teams.drop_member``) -- so a
delete cannot slip between "the crew exists" and "the team is written" and
leave a team naming a crewmate that is gone -- and the lock the crew-create
route holds while it purges the new name from any team it was left on
(``crew_teams.release_name``) and registers it, so a recreated crew never
inherits a deleted one's membership.
